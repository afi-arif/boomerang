            <p>Our Barking Road project was originally a five-bedroom care home that we secured with the intention of attaining planning permission for both a change of use and of format, converting the building into a selection of residential apartments.</p>
            <p>We applied for and were awarded permission to proceed with a three-storey rear extension to the property and redeveloped the newly-extended building into a total of five apartments.</p>
            <p>These range from one to three bedrooms, with one of the one-bedroom apartments being particularly large and well-appointed for the area, targeting the premium lettings market and correlating hig her rental incomes.</p>
            <p>As the site was initially zoned as a commercial premises, the deposit required from the client to secure the building was rather hig her than the norm at 30%; however, our development works have increased the rental value of the premises as a whole by an impressive 62%.</p>
            <p>After completion of the relevant works and refinancing of the project in accordance with its increased value, our clientâ€™s net contribution to the project totalled just 52,000.</p>
